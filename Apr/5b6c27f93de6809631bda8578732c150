The highly photogenic city of Bristol has too rarely been used on the widescreen. But a couple of years ago, there was Starter for 10 and now in Flying Blind we have a good-looking, fortysomething heroine (the excellent Helen McCrory) living in a flat in a beautiful Georgian crescent overlooking the city from Clifton, working at Filton airport and dining out at suave restaurants in the old central dockland. McCrory is Frankie, an aeronautical scientist, daughter of a retired aircraft engineer (Kenneth Cranham) who had worked on Concorde. She has a top security job, designing drones for the MoD, and gets picked up by a 24-year-old Algerian refugee, Kahil (Najib Oudghiri), who's been sitting in on her lectures at Bristol University. A torrid affair with this handsome student ensues, after he's left her some lines from an Arabic love poem and she's seen his torture scars. But soon, she becomes involved in what might be terrorism, and the film's strategy is to use the mechanics of suspense to make the audience recognise its own readiness to misread evidence and suspect any foreigner. The eroticism and passion are convincing and, for a while, Frankie's naivety is plausible. But the plotting is B-feature stuff and Kahil is a creepy, ingratiating figure, worthy of anyone's suspicion. The film-maker's approach to the threat of Islamic fundamentalism is fuelled by the same liberal guilt that makes Frankie so vulnerable.
